        <h1> About Me </h1>

        <h2> I'm a freelance photographer </h2>
        <p> who enjoys taking family and individual photo's </p>

        <p> My passion for photography grew when my baby girl was born. All I wanted to do was take pictures of her all day long! <br>
        </p>

        <p> I have loads of experience with young children and passionately enjoy <br>capturing moments of <em> laughter and love! </em> </p>

        <p> I can set up a beautiful scene for a family or portrait photo <br>
            or I can capture those happy candid photos during a special event. </p>
